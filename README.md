## What are Design Patterns?

The concept of design patterns in software engineering was popularized in the early 1990s by the famous book **["Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"](https://amzn.to/3SKaa9x)** by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, collectively known as the "Gang of Four" (GoF). However, the roots of design patterns go back further, drawing inspiration from the field of architecture.

Architect Christopher Alexander introduced the idea of patterns in architecture in his 1977 book **"A Pattern Language,"** where he described solutions to common design problems in urban planning and building architecture. Alexander's work emphasized that each pattern solves a specific problem and is part of a more extensive design system. This approach resonated with software developers facing similar challenges in software construction.

Seeing the potential of Alexander's concepts in software development, the GoF adapted and expanded these ideas to object-oriented programming. Their book **introduced 23 design patterns categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns**, providing a standardized approach to solving common software design issues.

In software development, design patterns serve a similar purposeâ€”**they provide templated solutions to recurring problems**, ensuring that you don't have to reinvent the wheel each time you encounter a familiar issue.

## Design Pattern Types

Design patterns can be separated into three main categories:

* **Creational Patterns** - Object creation

    - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful for managing resources like database connections.

    - **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It's ideal when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses, and must create an instance of one of these subclasses based on some initialization parameters.

    - **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Offers an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern shines when you must ensure that the created objects can work together without knowing their exact types.

    - **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. This pattern is excellent for when you need to create an object with many optional or required components.

    - **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the cost of creating an object is heavier than copying an existing one.

* **Structural Patterns** - Object assembly

    - **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate without changing their existing code. This pattern is perfect when integrating new features or libraries without disrupting existing code.

    - **Composite Pattern**: Enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It's ideal for representing part-whole hierarchies where you want to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

    - **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it. This is useful for lazy loading, controlling access, or logging, acting as an intermediary between the client and the actual object to add a processing layer.

    - **Flyweight Pattern**: Minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects; it's a boon for efficiency when working with many objects with some shared state.

    - **Facade Pattern**: Offers a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library, or framework. Providing a higher-level interface makes the subsystem easier to use, reducing complexity and promoting decoupling.

    - **Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It's particularly useful when extending a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.

    - **Decorator Pattern**: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
