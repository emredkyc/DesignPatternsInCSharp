## What are Design Patterns?

The concept of design patterns in software engineering was popularized in the early 1990s by the famous book **["Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"](https://amzn.to/3SKaa9x)** by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, collectively known as the "Gang of Four" (GoF). However, the roots of design patterns go back further, drawing inspiration from the field of architecture.

Architect Christopher Alexander introduced the idea of patterns in architecture in his 1977 book **"A Pattern Language,"** where he described solutions to common design problems in urban planning and building architecture. Alexander's work emphasized that each pattern solves a specific problem and is part of a more extensive design system. This approach resonated with software developers facing similar challenges in software construction.

Seeing the potential of Alexander's concepts in software development, the GoF adapted and expanded these ideas to object-oriented programming. Their book **introduced 23 design patterns categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns**, providing a standardized approach to solving common software design issues.

In software development, design patterns serve a similar purposeâ€”**they provide templated solutions to recurring problems**, ensuring that you don't have to reinvent the wheel each time you encounter a familiar issue.
